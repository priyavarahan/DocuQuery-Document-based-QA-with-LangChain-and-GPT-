# DocuQuery-Document-based-QA-with-LangChain-and-GPT-
Constructed a Streamlit-based Question-Answering application integrating LangChain and OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3.5 Turbo model for efficient natural language processing of PDF, DOCX, and TXT files.

## Overview
This repository contains a Streamlit-based Question-Answering (QA) application that leverages LangChain and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model for efficient natural language processing of PDF, DOCX, and TXT files. The application includes various features such as document chunking, embedding creation using OpenAIEmbeddings, and persistent chat history, showcasing proficiency in document processing, vector storage, and user interface design.

## Features

1. **Document Processing:**
   - The application supports PDF, DOCX, and TXT file formats for efficient document processing.
   - Document chunking is implemented to handle large files effectively.

2. **Embedding Creation:**
   - OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model is used to create embeddings for natural language understanding.
   - LangChain is integrated to enhance the language processing capabilities.

3. **User Interface:**
